  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The pabell贸n criollo is a traditional Venezuelan gastronomic dish, and is considered the "national dish of Venezuela".234 It is so called because of its resemblance to a flag, as it combines different colors.1 The traditional pabell贸n criollo is composed of cooked white rice, larded beef, black beans and slices of fried ripe plantain.</p>
  <p>The history of the pabell贸n dates back to imperial times, probably the eighteenth century,7 and the story goes that it is basically a gathering of "leftovers" from previous meals by the slaves of the haciendas: meat, rice and black beans were usually from the previous day or two, with the plantain slices being the only thing prepared at the time. This is one version.</p>
