  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Venezuelan Cachapa is a traditional recipe shared with us by María Beatriz and Helmut, authors of the blog Amantes de la Cocina. They want to share this preparation that they define as a snack similar to a pancake but made with tender corn, we are already looking forward to trying it...
  </p>
  <p>Well, for people like us who want to know the gastronomy of other countries, and for Venezuelans like María Beatriz, who lives in Spain and longs for the flavors of her homeland, they share the recipe of Venezuelan Cachapa in their section Hoy Cocinas Tú, adjusting to the ingredients that can be found in supermarkets of any country, so we have no excuse to try this recipe that they recommend for a brunch, for breakfast, for a snack, for dinner ... isn't it easy to find a good time? Well, take note, below you can see the written and video elaboration.

  <ul>
    <li>450 grams of corn kernels (can be frozen or canned)</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 whole "L" size eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon wheat flour (optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons corn flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>sliced mozzarella cheese to fill the cachapas (since where we live we can't find "queso e'mano")</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Place all the ingredients, except the eggs and butter, in a blender and blend until you obtain a medium consistency, neither too thick nor too liquid. At the end add the butter and the eggs and continue blending for another minute. If the mixture is too runny, add a little wheat flour to thicken it.
  </li><br>
    <li>Pour the mixture into a container, cover with paper or plastic wrap and let it stand for about 20 minutes in the refrigerator.
  </li><br>
    <li>Heat a Teflon frying pan and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li><br>
    <li>With the help of a ladle, pour a little of the mixture into the pan and distribute it until you have a circumference of approximately 12-14 cm. and about 5 mm. thick. If you want to make mini-cachapas, make them as small as you like.</li><br>
    <li>Wait for it to cook on one side, you will see bubbles and holes start to appear on the surface and it turns golden brown underneath. This means that the mixture is drying out and it is time to turn them over.</li><br>
    <li>When it is golden brown on both sides, take it out of the pan and immediately spread it with butter, fill it with the cheese and fold it in half.</li><br>
    <li>The cachapa is eaten hot, so let's go straight to the table to enjoy the Venezuelan flavor.</li><br>
    <li>Enjoy your meal!</li>
  </ol>
